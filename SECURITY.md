# Security

## Found a Security Issue?

If you find a security vulnerability, please don't create a public issue. Instead:

- Email me directly, or
- Use GitHub's private security advisory feature

I'll try to respond within a few days. Please include:

- What the issue is
- Where you found it (which file/line)
- How to reproduce it
- What you think the impact might be

## What I'm Doing for Security

This project includes:

- JWT authentication
- Basic input validation
- SQLite database (local development)
- CORS configuration
- Environment variables for sensitive data

This is a learning project, so security measures are basic but functional.

## Questions?

Just create a regular GitHub issue if you have questions about security practices in this project.
